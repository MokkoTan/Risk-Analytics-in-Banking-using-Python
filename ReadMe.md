## Context
### Business Understanding
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. 

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.


## My Role and Objectives 

As a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. I have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants are capable of repaying the loans are not rejected.

-  How does Previous Application affect Current Application
-  Suggest methods to improve/ reduce the number of Defaulter
